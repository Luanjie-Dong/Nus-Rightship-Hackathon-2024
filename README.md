# NUS-RightShip Hackathon Project

## Overview

Participated in the NUS-RightShip hackathonâ€™s 22-hour challenge to develop a baseline assessment of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions at Pasir Panjang Terminal
and evaluated the impact of electrification on emissions reduction. This project involved the utilization of various technical skills, including GeoPandas, 
shape files, and Pandas for data analysis and visualization.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to:
1. Develop a baseline assessment of GHG emissions at Pasir Panjang Terminal.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of electrification in reducing GHG emissions.

### Key Considerations:
- Is electrification an effective method to reduce GHG emissions?
- How much GHG emissions can be reduced when electrification is used?
- What is the variation in electrical load demand during daytime versus nighttime?
