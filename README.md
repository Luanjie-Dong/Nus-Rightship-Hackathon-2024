# NUS-RightShip Hackathon Project

## Overview

Participated in the NUS-RightShip hackathonâ€™s 22-hour challenge to develop a baseline assessment of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions at Pasir Panjang Terminal
and evaluated the impact of electrification on emissions reduction. This project involved the utilization of various technical skills, including GeoPandas, 
shape files, and Pandas for data analysis and visualization.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to:
1. Develop a baseline assessment of GHG emissions at Pasir Panjang Terminal.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of electrification in reducing GHG emissions.

### Key Considerations:
- Is electrification an effective method to reduce GHG emissions?
- How much GHG emissions can be reduced when electrification is used?
- What is the variation in electrical load demand during daytime versus nighttime?

## Technical Skills Utilized

- **GeoPandas**: For spatial data analysis and manipulation.
- **Shape Files**: To handle geospatial data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

## Methodology

### Baseline GHG Emissions Assessment
1. **Data Cleaning**: Processed the data to remove inconsistencies and ensure accuracy using Pandas.
2. **Analysis**: Used GeoPandas , shape files and pandas to analyze spatial data and visualize emission sources and levels.

### Evaluation of Electrification Impact
1. **Comparison**: Compared emissions in the electrified scenario versus the current state.
2. **Load Demand Variation**: Analyzed variations in electrical load demand during daytime and nighttime to understand the operational implications of electrification.
